## CI/CD with Circle CI

The project includes continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) with Circle CI. Here's how it works:

- On every push to the repository, the CI pipeline runs automated tests and checks.
- Once the tests pass successfully, the CD pipeline deploys the changes to a staging environment for further testing.
- After staging verification, changes are promoted to the production environment.
